The aim of this study is to examine the correlation between wind energy generation and electricity prices in Germany[2]. The analysis uses data obtained from the German transmission system operator, smard.de [1], for the year 2022. Two datasets were obtained: total wind energy generation and day-ahead electricity prices.
